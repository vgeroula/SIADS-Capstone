## How to run the code
Before starting, make sure that all the Python libraries listed in the "requirements.txt" file are installed in the machine where the code will run.
1. Store the data files (CSV) in a folder called "Data", which resides in the same directory as the Python scripts.
There are in total 5 CSV files expected to be in the "Data" folder: "item_categories.csv", "items.csv", "shops.csv", "sales_train.csv", "test.csv"
All these CSV files can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data
